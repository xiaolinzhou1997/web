  I am currently a second year PhD student at [department](https://www.umass.edu/resec/) of resource economics, UMass Amherst. I completed my MS in agricultural and resource economics at [Arizona](https://economics.arizona.edu/) while watching [saguaro cactus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguaro) grow slowly every day. My interests in economics all started back when I was an undergraduate in Taiwan, witnessing people marching against nuclear power plants but breathing polluted air emitted by [giant coal fired plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taichung_Power_Plant). Today I explore broad topics in Industrial Organization with a particular focus on electricity market. Will write blog posts about my thoughts and fun things I encounter in my academic journey soon, and of course, throw school stuff in [ECON NOTES + CODE](xiaolinzhou1997.github.io/project/)!
