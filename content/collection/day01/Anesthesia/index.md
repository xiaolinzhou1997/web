I study, go to class, read [lecture notes](https://sites.duke.edu/econ890_02_f2019/files/2019/09/890_Demand_2019.pdf), edit research proposals, discuss terrible ideas with professors.

I code slow 25-parameter random coefficient logit models that never converge, write homework 48 hours continuously before it's due and still past due, sketch matrix operations on a piece of paper and fail to come up with a faster algorithm.

I stay in office 14 hours a day, and drink coffee at 9 pm. I chain smoke and have one meal a day. I find happiness when driving home at 80 mph with no other cars on the tarmac, no break when circling the roundabout. 

I drink stout, those sticky dark Irish beer, at home. I don't finish them, always leave a bottom in the glass, until they stink and emit alcohol vapor. 

I listen to [classical guitar](https://youtu.be/0_RnlOWmZD4), [duo that is no longer trending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaUPOsxHVt8), [songs that I first encountered at 12](https://youtu.be/HgVUKTVH4bc), [singer who passed away 25 years ago](https://youtu.be/9UVjjcOUJLE), and [something mistakenly entered playlist](https://youtu.be/jbLW2FtCliA).
  
It's probably the time to get rid of 三百青丝 to embrace this severe winter.

I wish all is well.
